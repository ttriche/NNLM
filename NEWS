NNLM-0.4.4: 2020-02-01
======================
- fixed according to CRAN request.

NNLM-0.4.3: 2019-06-29
======================
- fixed testing error
- fixed cpp flag for openmp

NNLM-0.4.2: 2017-05-17
======================
- bug fixed

NNLM-0.4.1: 2015-12-26
======================
- removed GNU g++ specific header for portability
- minor changes on documentation

NNLM-0.4.0: 2015-12-20
======================
- Re-designed interface of `nnmf`
- Re-designed all C++ codes for future extension
- Added sequential quadratic approximation to KL-divergence
- Integrated regularization into Lee's multiplicative algorithms
- More choices of algorithms for nonnegative linear model and renamed `nnls` to `nnlm`
- Removed `plot` method

NNLM-0.3.0: 2015-11-19
======================
- `nmf_partial` was updated to `nnmf_general`, with two more great features
	* NMF with masked entries in W and H forced to 0
	* Allowing missing values in matrix A, which is useful for missing
		value imputation and recommendation system.
- Add more potential applications on vignette

NNLM-0.2.0: 2015-11-08
======================
- NMF with partially known profiles, which can be used for
	tumour content deconvolution with known health profile
- Updated vignette

======================
- OpenMP support for multiple threading
- Added progression bar and keyboard interrupt
- Added a vignette

NNLM-0.0.2: 2015-10-31
